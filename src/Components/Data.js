		desc: "Meet your new favorite keto cookie recipe! Super-fine almond flour, erythritol, cream cheese, and butter come together to make these easy, soft keto 'sugar' cookies. While they appear and taste like classic sugar cookies, these guilt-free cookies are low in carbs, making them keto diet approved. They're incredibly rich thanks to the butter, cream cheese, and egg, while erythritol (a sugar-alcohol-based alternative sweetener) and vanilla extract provide the perfect amount of sweetness. Not only are they low-carb, but they're also gluten-free and grain-free — plus you can feel good about using erythritol because it's natural and tastes like sugar without the extra calories. An added bonus: they only take about 20 minutes to make.These keto cookies are perfect for any party or special occasion. They're always a hit around Christmas — sugar cookies are a holiday staple in most American households — and they make a great healthy option for holiday cookie swaps. The recipe is a Yummly original created by [Sara Mellas](https://www.yummly.com/dish/author/Sara%20Mellas).",
